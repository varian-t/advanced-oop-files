## Problem 3 (16 Points)
You are given a CSV file (data/comics.csv) that contains a database on comics.

Create a new C# Console Application and parse the CSV into a collection (You can use the CSVHelper library).

Create, run, and print the results of three LINQ queries on your collection. The queries should return the following:

1. All comics released before the year 2000 **(3 Points)**

2. The number of comics written by each author sorted by most comics written **(5 Points)**

3. For each year, the most active author in that year(the one who wrote the most comics). The result should be ordered by the year. **(8 Points)**
